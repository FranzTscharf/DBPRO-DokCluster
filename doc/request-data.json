A key enabler for these applications is phased array signal processing, especially Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation. However, accurate AoA estimation on commodity devices is non-trivial due to limited number of antennas and uncertain phase offsets. In this paper, we aim to enable practical AoA measurements on COTS mobile devices. The key insight is to involve users' natural rotation to conduce a relative incident signal of measurements at two orientations. Then by taking the differential phase, it is feasible to remove the phase offsets and derive the accurate AoA of the equivalent incoming signal, while the rotation angle can also be captured by built-in inertial sensors. On this basis, we propose Differential MUSIC (D-MUSIC), a relative form of the standard MUSIC algorithm that eliminates the unknown phase offsets and achieves accurate AoA estimation on COTS mobile devices with only one rotation. We further extend to 3-D space and fortify it in multipath-rich scenarios. We prototype D-MUSIC on commodity WiFi infrastructure and evaluate it in typical indoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance with an average AoA estimation error of 13 degrees.","type":"article-journal","title":"Enabling Phased Array Signal Processing for Mobile WiFi Devices","volume":"PP","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","id":14,"page":"1-1","issued":"2017","DOI":"10.1109\/TMC.2017.2778155"}

Optical signal processing applications such as amplification, wavelength conversion and all-optical switching in silicon are usually based on short optical pulses with high peak power because these pulses provide a high peak intensity, which enables nonlinear Kerr interactions while keeping the average optical power small to avoid free carriers absorption [1, 2]. However, short optical pulses may have a limited interaction length due to a limited temporal walk-off (mismatch of the group velocities of pump and signal). In low loss waveguides, e.g. optical fibers, at a certain pump-signal detuning the Kerr induced phase shift would cancel out the group velocity dispersion, leading to a small walk-off over a long propagation length [3]. However, in silicon waveguides the loss is much larger which leads to the change of nonlinear phase shift along the waveguide. This severely limits the phase matched propagation distance [4]. Previously, silicon taper structures have been considered to reduce the pulse broadening [5]. In this paper we show that with certain optimally designed silicon taper structures it is also possible to reduce the walk-off for nonlinear pump-signal applications such as wavelength conversion.","type":"paper-conference","title":"Optimum silicon taper structures with minimum temporal walk-off for nonlinear optical signal processing applications","event":"2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO\/Europe-EQEC)","issued":"2017-06","DOI":"10.1109\/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086579"}

Most backscatter protocols operate in a sequential TDMA-like manner due to the fact that most nodes cannot overhear each other's transmissions, which is detrimental for throughout and energy consumption. Recent efforts to separate concurrent signals by inverting a system of linear equations is also problematic due to varying channel coefficients caused by system and environmental dynamics. In this paper, we introduce BST, a novel physical layer for backscatter communication that enables concurrent transmission by leveraging intra-bit multiplexing of OOK signals from multiple tags. The key idea underlying BST is that the reader can sample at considerably higher rates than the tags, hence it can extract time-domain signal edges that result from interleaved transmissions of several tags. Our preliminary experiment results show that BST can achieve 5Ã the throughput of Buzz and 10Ã the throughput of TDMA-based solutions, such as EPC Gen 2.","type":"paper-conference","title":"Leveraging Interleaved Signal Edges for Concurrent Backscatter","URL":"http:\/\/doi.acm.org\/10.1145\/2643614.2643617","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3076-3","container-title":"Proceedings of the 1st ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Wireless","collection-title":"HotWireless '14","publisher":"ACM","id":30,"page":"13\u201318","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","issued":"2014","DOI":"10.1145\/2643614.2643617"}

As the fraction of interactions that take place in technology mediated settings keeps increasing, it is important to investigate how the cognitive and psychological processes mentioned above - ultimately grounded into neural structures - act in and react to the new interaction settings. In particular, it is important to investigate whether nonverbal communication - one of the main channels through which people convey socially and psychologically relevant information - still plays a role in settings where natural nonverbal cues (facial expressions, vocalisations, gestures, etc.) are no longer available.

We present two typical pulmonary blastomas one in a 43-year-old man and the other in an infant of six months, the youngest case yet reported. Several arguments exist in favor of the embryonic origin of these neoplams: their histogenesis, their resemblance to nephroblastomas, their bifocal or multifocal presence in certain cases, and in about one third of all cases their discovery in patients under 20 years of age. Histologically the tumoral tissue contains two components: an epithelial component in which tubes resembiling fetal bronchi are found, and a loose mesenchymal component of an embryonic type containing various areas of differentiation. Although some tumors evolve slowly or have been known for years, most of the time the appearance of symptoms is soon followed by hematogenous dissemination and rapid demise.

Unfortunately, sequencing machines are able to read only short fragments of DNA. Therefore, one of the basic steps in reconstructing novel genomes lies in putting these pieces of DNA, called reads, together into complete genome sequences using a process known as genome assembly. Reads joining, however, requires efficient detection of their overlaps. This is commonly performed by comparing the particular characters (A, C, G, T) of the reads using string processing techniques. In this paper, we present an alternative way of detecting overlaps using genomic signal processing. Unlike string comparison, numerical phase signals reflect the complementarity of double stranded DNA making the signal ideal for effective strand independent overlap detection using covariance with high accuracy.","type":"paper-conference","title":"Overlap Detection for a Genome Assembly Based on Genomic Signal Processing","event":"2017 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)","issued":"2017-06","DOI":"10.1109\/CBMS.2017.140"}

It was reported that electrical stimulation to rat PDL elicited activation of the insular oral region (IOR) and the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices. However, the physiological relationship between S1 and S2\/IOR is not well understood. To address this issue, we performed in vivo optical imaging using a voltage-sensitive dye. Our results demonstrated that the electrical stimulation to the PDL of the mandibular incisor evoked the simultaneous activation of S1 and the S2\/IOR. The stimulation to the initial response area of the S1 evoked responses in the S2\/IOR, and vice versa. An injection of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to the cortical region between S1 and S2\/IOR attenuated such elicited responses only in the non-stimulated cortical partner site. The cortico-cortical interaction between S1 and S2\/IOR was suppressed by the application of TTX, indicating that these two cortical regions bi-directionally communicate the signal processing of PDL sensations. An injection of FluoroGoldâ¢ (FG) to the initial response area in S1 or the S2\/IOR showed that FG-positive cells were scattered in the non-injected cortical counterpart. This morphological result demonstrated the presence of a bi-directional intracortical connection between the initial response areas in S1 and the S2\/IOR.

In particular, our contribution is twofold in this work. i) First, we construct a general architecture for achieving the functionality of wireless positioning based on the principle of the switched injection-locked oscillator (SILO). Unlike the previous SILO-based schemes, some limitations on the pulsed waveform generated by the tags are overcome. In addition, only one reader set up with multiple receiving antennas is used to precisely localize tags based on the delay and Direction-Of- Arrival (DOA) estimates. ii) Second, the developed algorithms make use of a shift invariant property among the baseband signal snapshots of intra- and\/or inter-modulation intervals, i.e., snapshots in one modulation period and\/or sets of snapshots in multiple modulation periods. A new joint singular value decomposition (JSVD) based ESPRIT algorithm is developed for determining the number of multiple active tags and their positions by implementing the matrix reconstruction and stacking techniques. The proposed method has its basic foundation on the processing of received data with global fusion scheme. In this way, this method can improve the performance of parameter estimates in terms of accuracy and resolution without suffering from the pair matching problem.

The socio-cultural complexity of user behavior aimed at algorithmic invisibility (such as subtweeting, mock-retweeting, use of \"screen captures\" for text, etc.) further complicate interpretation of big data social media.

In this paper, the sensor network is perceived as the fundamental layer of the smart habitat, and inference is provided not only by direct operation on acquired signals, but also network model is identified for recorded ozone (O3) data in 100 measurement points deployed in Poland. It means that a graph as a mathematical representation of the complex network is generated, which links system features and behaviors coded in measured data sets. Results of multiscale projections are commented for ozone data sets. Furthermore, in opposite to the classical signal processing, the spectral analysis for graph signals is demonstrated, including reconstruction of graph Laplacian and Fourier transform calculation for signals spanned on graph vertices.

In conventional signal processing methods, random signals are treated as statistically stationary and the parameters of the underlying physical mechanism that generates the signal would not vary in time. However, for most manmade signals, some parameters vary periodically with time and this requires that random signals be modeled as cyclostationary. In the field of sonar, the propeller noise signal generated by underwater vessels is cyclostationary. As a ship propagates in the sea, noise generated during the collapse of cavitation-induced bubbles are modulated by the rotating propeller shaft and this results in characteristic amplitude modulated random noise signal, which can be detected using passive sonar. Processing these signals, the number of blades and the shaft frequency of the propeller can be identified. In this work, cyclostationary processing technique is introduced for processing propeller noise signal and it is observed to provide better noise immunity. A detailed comparison with the conventional DEMON processing is also presented.","type":"article-journal","title":"Cyclostationarity Based Sonar Signal Processing","URL":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1877050916315095","journalAbbreviation":"Procedia Computer Science","volume":"93","container-title":"Procedia Computer Science","collection-title":"Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications","id":77,"page":"683-689","issued":"2016-01-01","DOI":"10.1016\/j.procs.2016.07.263"}

In this paper, we designed a child-adult imitation task to investigate how automatically computable cues on turn-taking and movements can give insight into high-level perception of coordination. First we collected a human questionnaire to evaluate the perceived coordination of the dyads. Then, we extracted automatically computable cues and information on dialog acts from the video clips. The automatic cues characterized speech and gestural turn-takings and coordinated movements of the dyad. We finally confronted human scores with automatic cues to search which cues could be informative on the perception of coordination during the task. We found that the adult adjusted his behavior according to the child need and that a disruption of the gestural turn-taking rhythm was badly perceived by the judges. We also found, that judges rated negatively the dyads that talked more as speech intervenes when the child had difficulties to imitate.

{"issue":"Supplement C","author":["Ahmad, Muneer","Jung, Low Tan","Bhuiyan, Al-Amin"],"ISSN":"0169-2607","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"Digital signal processing techniques commonly employ fixed length window filters to process the signal contents. DNA signals differ in characteristics from common digital signals since they carry nucleotides as contents. The nucleotides own genetic code context and fuzzy behaviors due to their special structure and order in DNA strand. Employing conventional fixed length window filters for DNA signal processing produce spectral leakage and hence results in signal noise. A biological context aware adaptive window filter is required to process the DNA signals. This paper introduces a biological inspired fuzzy adaptive window median filter (FAWMF) which computes the fuzzy membership strength of nucleotides in each slide of window and filters nucleotides based on median filtering with a combination of s-shaped and z-shaped filters. Since coding regions cause 3-base periodicity by an unbalanced nucleotides' distribution producing a relatively high bias for nucleotides' usage, such fundamental characteristic of nucleotides has been exploited in FAWMF to suppress the signal noise. Along with adaptive response of FAWMF, a strong correlation between median nucleotides and the Î  shaped filter was observed which produced enhanced discrimination between coding and non-coding regions contrary to fixed length conventional window filters. The proposed FAWMF attains a significant enhancement in coding regions identification i.e. 40% to 125% as compared to other conventional window filters tested over more than 250 benchmarked and randomly taken DNA datasets of different organisms. This study proves that conventional fixed length window filters applied to DNA signals do not achieve significant results since the nucleotides carry genetic code context. The proposed FAWMF algorithm is adaptive and outperforms significantly to process DNA signal contents. The algorithm applied to variety of DNA datasets produced noteworthy discrimination between coding and non-coding regions contrary to fixed window length conventional filters.","type":"article-journal","title":"A biological inspired fuzzy adaptive window median filter (FAWMF) for enhancing DNA signal processing","URL":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0169260716303728","journalAbbreviation":"Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","volume":"149","container-title":"Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","id":106,"page":"11-17","issued":"2017-10-01","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cmpb.2017.06.021"}

We describe two software implementations based on these dictionaries. Both implementations rely on functions defined on an interval to avoid edge effects. One implementation allows for users to have great flexibility in the Gabor dictionary to be used. This is a useful improvement over other implementations, which only allow for a fixed dictionary.

However, current research is focussing mainly on the analysis of centre of pressure excursion and lacks consensus on how to assess joint movement during postural control tasks. This study introduces a new signal processing technique to comprehensively quantify joint sway during standing and evaluates its reproducibility. Fifteen patients with non-specific low back pain and ten asymptomatic participants performed three repetitions of a 60-second standing task on foam surface. This procedure was repeated on a second day. Lumbar spine movement was recorded using an inertial measurement system. The signal was temporally divided into six sections. Two outcome variables (mean absolute sway and sways per second) were calculated for each section. The reproducibility of single and averaged measurements was quantified with linear mixed-effects models and the generalizability theory. A single measurement of ten seconds duration revealed reliability coefficients of .75 for mean absolute sway and .76 for sways per second. Averaging a measurement of 40 seconds duration on two different days revealed reliability coefficients higher than .90 for both outcome variables. The outcome variables\u2019 reliability compares favourably to previously published results using different signal processing techniques or centre of pressure excursion. The introduced signal processing technique with two outcome variables to quantify joint sway during standing proved to be a highly reliable method.

The machine's current reaction to voltage step excitation is used to obtain saliency signals. The proposed procedure is based on a digital signal processing implementation of the discrete sine and cosine transforms for extracting the slotting saliency signal at close and equal frequencies of the slotting and saturation saliencies under heavy load operation. The proposed algorithms are processed based on an online adaptive threshold. Using the proposed separation algorithm guarantees precise estimation of rotor\/flux angle and efficient sensorless control of the induction machine. A sensorless induction motor drive is implemented in the laboratory. Extensive experimental results are presented. A performance comparison between the proposed algorithm and previous works is provided. The robustness and effectiveness of the applied signal processing algorithms for sensorless torque control are verified at low speed and heavy load.","type":"article-journal","title":"Discrete Sine and Cosine Transforms for Signal Processing Spectral Overlap Saliencies of Induction Machine","volume":"65","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","id":121,"page":"189-199","issued":"2018-01","DOI":"10.1109\/TIE.2017.2714124"}

Hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity are the key behavioral features observed in children with ADHD. ADHD is normally diagnosed only when a child continues to have symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention at a greater degree than the normal for six months or more. In recent years there has been significant research to diagnose ADHD in a quantitative way using medical imaging and signal processing techniques. This paper presents a review of recent research on diagnosis of ADHD using medical imaging and signal processing techniques. This research is especially valuable for early diagnosis of ADHD.","type":"article-journal","title":"Diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder using imaging and signal processing techniques","URL":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0010482517302342","journalAbbreviation":"Computers in Biology and Medicine","volume":"88","container-title":"Computers in Biology and Medicine","id":122,"page":"93-99","issued":"2017-09-01","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compbiomed.2017.07.009"}
