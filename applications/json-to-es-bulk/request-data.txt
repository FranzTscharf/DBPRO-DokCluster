Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength Ω becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system ω. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few (<;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well.

Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c).

A key enabler for these applications is phased array signal processing, especially Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation. However, accurate AoA estimation on commodity devices is non-trivial due to limited number of antennas and uncertain phase offsets. In this paper, we aim to enable practical AoA measurements on COTS mobile devices. The key insight is to involve users' natural rotation to conduce a relative incident signal of measurements at two orientations. Then by taking the differential phase, it is feasible to remove the phase offsets and derive the accurate AoA of the equivalent incoming signal, while the rotation angle can also be captured by built-in inertial sensors. On this basis, we propose Differential MUSIC (D-MUSIC), a relative form of the standard MUSIC algorithm that eliminates the unknown phase offsets and achieves accurate AoA estimation on COTS mobile devices with only one rotation. We further extend to 3-D space and fortify it in multipath-rich scenarios. We prototype D-MUSIC on commodity WiFi infrastructure and evaluate it in typical indoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance with an average AoA estimation error of 13 degrees.","DOI":"10.1109/TMC.2017.2778155","ISSN":"1536-1233","author":[{"family":"Qian","given":"K."},{"family":"Wu","given":"C."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Z."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Z."},{"family":"Wang","given":"X."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Y."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]}}

After reviewing various flavors for spin-wave-based processing devices, we argue that the niche for spin-wave-based devices is low-power, compact and high-speed signal-processing devices, where most traditional electronics show poor performance.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960116316486","DOI":"10.1016/j.physleta.2017.02.042","ISSN":"0375-9601","journalAbbreviation":"Physics Letters A","author":[{"family":"Csaba","given":"György"},{"family":"Papp","given":"Ádám"},{"family":"Porod","given":"Wolfgang"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,3]]}}

Optical signal processing applications such as amplification, wavelength conversion and all-optical switching in silicon are usually based on short optical pulses with high peak power because these pulses provide a high peak intensity, which enables nonlinear Kerr interactions while keeping the average optical power small to avoid free carriers absorption [1, 2]. However, short optical pulses may have a limited interaction length due to a limited temporal walk-off (mismatch of the group velocities of pump and signal). In low loss waveguides, e.g. optical fibers, at a certain pump-signal detuning the Kerr induced phase shift would cancel out the group velocity dispersion, leading to a small walk-off over a long propagation length [3]. However, in silicon waveguides the loss is much larger which leads to the change of nonlinear phase shift along the waveguide. This severely limits the phase matched propagation distance [4]. Previously, silicon taper structures have been considered to reduce the pulse broadening [5]. In this paper we show that with certain optimally designed silicon taper structures it is also possible to reduce the walk-off for nonlinear pump-signal applications such as wavelength conversion.","DOI":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086579","author":[{"family":"Jazayerifar","given":"M."},{"family":"Aminpour","given":"H."},{"family":"Jamshidi","given":"K."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6]]}}

Most backscatter protocols operate in a sequential TDMA-like manner due to the fact that most nodes cannot overhear each other's transmissions, which is detrimental for throughout and energy consumption. Recent efforts to separate concurrent signals by inverting a system of linear equations is also problematic due to varying channel coefficients caused by system and environmental dynamics. In this paper, we introduce BST, a novel physical layer for backscatter communication that enables concurrent transmission by leveraging intra-bit multiplexing of OOK signals from multiple tags. The key idea underlying BST is that the reader can sample at considerably higher rates than the tags, hence it can extract time-domain signal edges that result from interleaved transmissions of several tags. Our preliminary experiment results show that BST can achieve 5× the throughput of Buzz and 10× the throughput of TDMA-based solutions, such as EPC Gen 2.","URL":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2643614.2643617","DOI":"10.1145/2643614.2643617","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3076-3","author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Pan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Pengyu"},{"family":"Ganesan","given":"Deepak"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]}}

It was reported that electrical stimulation to rat PDL elicited activation of the insular oral region (IOR) and the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices. However, the physiological relationship between S1 and S2/IOR is not well understood. To address this issue, we performed in vivo optical imaging using a voltage-sensitive dye. Our results demonstrated that the electrical stimulation to the PDL of the mandibular incisor evoked the simultaneous activation of S1 and the S2/IOR. The stimulation to the initial response area of the S1 evoked responses in the S2/IOR, and vice versa. An injection of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to the cortical region between S1 and S2/IOR attenuated such elicited responses only in the non-stimulated cortical partner site. The cortico-cortical interaction between S1 and S2/IOR was suppressed by the application of TTX, indicating that these two cortical regions bi-directionally communicate the signal processing of PDL sensations. An injection of FluoroGold™ (FG) to the initial response area in S1 or the S2/IOR showed that FG-positive cells were scattered in the non-injected cortical counterpart. This morphological result demonstrated the presence of a bi-directional intracortical connection between the initial response areas in S1 and the S2/IOR.

Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms.

We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large Ω/ωc = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling Ω ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom.

These applications are subject to responsiveness constraints for user interactivity and, at the same time, must be optimized for energy efficiency. The increasingly heterogeneous power-versus-performance profile of modern hardware introduces new opportunities for energy savings as well as challenges. In this line, recent systems-on-chip (SoC) composed of low-power multicore processors, combined with a small graphics accelerator (or GPU), yield a notable increment of the computational capacity while partially retaining the appealing low power consumption of embedded systems. This paper analyzes the potential of these new hardware systems to accelerate applications that involve a large number of floating-point arithmetic operations mainly in the form of convolutions. To assess the performance, a headphone-based spatial audio application for mobile devices based on a Samsung Exynos 5422 SoC has been developed. We discuss different implementations and analyze the tradeoffs between performance and energy efficiency for different scenarios and configurations. Our experimental results reveal that we can extend the battery lifetime of a device featuring such an architecture by a 238% by properly configuring and leveraging the computational resources.","DOI":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2761909","ISSN":"1549-8328","author":[{"family":"Belloch","given":"J.

In particular, our contribution is twofold in this work. i) First, we construct a general architecture for achieving the functionality of wireless positioning based on the principle of the switched injection-locked oscillator (SILO). Unlike the previous SILO-based schemes, some limitations on the pulsed waveform generated by the tags are overcome. In addition, only one reader set up with multiple receiving antennas is used to precisely localize tags based on the delay and Direction-Of- Arrival (DOA) estimates. ii) Second, the developed algorithms make use of a shift invariant property among the baseband signal snapshots of intra- and/or inter-modulation intervals, i.e., snapshots in one modulation period and/or sets of snapshots in multiple modulation periods. A new joint singular value decomposition (JSVD) based ESPRIT algorithm is developed for determining the number of multiple active tags and their positions by implementing the matrix reconstruction and stacking techniques. The proposed method has its basic foundation on the processing of received data with global fusion scheme. In this way, this method can improve the performance of parameter estimates in terms of accuracy and resolution without suffering from the pair matching problem.

Results of multiscale projections are commented for ozone data sets. Furthermore, in opposite to the classical signal processing, the spectral analysis for graph signals is demonstrated, including reconstruction of graph Laplacian and Fourier transform calculation for signals spanned on graph vertices.

At the same time, advances in silicon technology due to shrinking feature sizes and increased performance parameters alone won't provide the necessary gain, especially in energy efficiency for wireless transceivers, which have tightly constrained power and energy budgets. In this paper, we highlight the challenges for wireless digital baseband signal processing beyond 100 Gbit/s and the limitations of today's architectures.

This paper attempts to offer a broader definition of big data that captures its other unique and defining characteristics. The rapid evolution and adoption of big data by industry has leapfrogged the discourse to popular outlets, forcing the academic press to catch up. Academic journals in numerous disciplines, which will benefit from a relevant discussion of big data, have yet to cover the topic. This paper presents a consolidated description of big data by integrating definitions from practitioners and academics. The paper's primary focus is on the analytic methods used for big data. A particular distinguishing feature of this paper is its focus on analytics related to unstructured data, which constitute 95% of big data. This paper highlights the need to develop appropriate and efficient analytical methods to leverage massive volumes of heterogeneous data in unstructured text, audio, and video formats. This paper also reinforces the need to devise new tools for predictive analytics for structured big data. The statistical methods in practice were devised to infer from sample data. The heterogeneity, noise, and the massive size of structured big data calls for developing computationally efficient algorithms that may avoid big data pitfalls, such as spurious correlation.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401214001066","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.10.007","ISSN":"0268-4012","shortTitle":"Beyond the hype","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Information Management","author":[{"family":"Gandomi","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Haider","given":"Murtaza"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,27]]}}

In conventional signal processing methods, random signals are treated as statistically stationary and the parameters of the underlying physical mechanism that generates the signal would not vary in time. However, for most manmade signals, some parameters vary periodically with time and this requires that random signals be modeled as cyclostationary. In the field of sonar, the propeller noise signal generated by underwater vessels is cyclostationary. As a ship propagates in the sea, noise generated during the collapse of cavitation-induced bubbles are modulated by the rotating propeller shaft and this results in characteristic amplitude modulated random noise signal, which can be detected using passive sonar. Processing these signals, the number of blades and the shaft frequency of the propeller can be identified. In this work, cyclostationary processing technique is introduced for processing propeller noise signal and it is observed to provide better noise immunity. A detailed comparison with the conventional DEMON processing is also presented.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916315095","DOI":"10.1016/j.procs.2016.07.263","ISSN":"1877-0509","journalAbbreviation":"Procedia Computer Science","author":[{"family":"Rajan","given":"Reshma"},{"family":"Deepa","given":"B."},{"family":"Bhai","given":"D.

The method is based on the data fusion at feature level and uses the measurement uncertainty of the imbalance as a figure of merit for the weight computation. A static, a dynamic, and a hybrid implementation are presented. In the static one, the weights are computed in a dedicated training phase, in which four algorithms (Fourier transform and quasi-harmonic fitting of signal denoised with Hilbert-Huang Transform, Hilbert Vibration decomposition, and Wavelet Packet decomposition) have been used to estimate the known imbalance of car wheels. In the dynamic one, the weights are computed at runtime by estimating the difference between each predictor and the actual signal. The hybrid approach is the combination of the two algorithms.

The automatic cues characterized speech and gestural turn-takings and coordinated movements of the dyad. We finally confronted human scores with automatic cues to search which cues could be informative on the perception of coordination during the task. We found that the adult adjusted his behavior according to the child need and that a disruption of the gestural turn-taking rhythm was badly perceived by the judges. We also found, that judges rated negatively the dyads that talked more as speech intervenes when the child had difficulties to imitate. Finally, coherence measures between the partners' movement features seemed more adequate than correlation to characterize their coordination.","URL":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2070481.2070546","DOI":"10.1145/2070481.2070546","ISBN":"978-1-4503-0641-6","shortTitle":"Characterization of Coordination in an Imitation Task","author":[{"family":"Delaherche","given":"Emilie"},{"family":"Chetouani","given":"Mohamed"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]}}

Despite the high volume of these devices, there are few existing programming frameworks that target full and simultaneous utilization of all CPU and GPU devices of the platform. This article presents a dataflow-flavored Model of Computation (MoC) that has been developed for deploying signal processing applications to heterogeneous platforms. The presented MoC is dynamic and allows describing applications with data dependent run-time behavior. On top of the MoC, formal design rules are presented that enable application descriptions to be simultaneously dynamic and decidable. Decidability guarantees compile-time application analyzability for deadlock freedom and bounded memory. The presented MoC and the design rules are realized in a novel Open Source programming environment “PRUNE” and demonstrated with representative application examples from the domains of image processing, computer vision and wireless communications. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in analyzability, flexibility and performance.","DOI":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2773424","ISSN":"1053-587X","shortTitle":"PRUNE","author":[{"family":"Boutellier","given":"J."},{"family":"Wu","given":"J."},{"family":"Huttunen","given":"H."},{"family":"Bhattacharyya","given":"S.

DNA signals differ in characteristics from common digital signals since they carry nucleotides as contents. The nucleotides own genetic code context and fuzzy behaviors due to their special structure and order in DNA strand. Employing conventional fixed length window filters for DNA signal processing produce spectral leakage and hence results in signal noise. A biological context aware adaptive window filter is required to process the DNA signals. This paper introduces a biological inspired fuzzy adaptive window median filter (FAWMF) which computes the fuzzy membership strength of nucleotides in each slide of window and filters nucleotides based on median filtering with a combination of s-shaped and z-shaped filters. Since coding regions cause 3-base periodicity by an unbalanced nucleotides' distribution producing a relatively high bias for nucleotides' usage, such fundamental characteristic of nucleotides has been exploited in FAWMF to suppress the signal noise. Along with adaptive response of FAWMF, a strong correlation between median nucleotides and the Π shaped filter was observed which produced enhanced discrimination between coding and non-coding regions contrary to fixed length conventional window filters. The proposed FAWMF attains a significant enhancement in coding regions identification i.e. 40% to 125% as compared to other conventional window filters tested over more than 250 benchmarked and randomly taken DNA datasets of different organisms. This study proves that conventional fixed length window filters applied to DNA signals do not achieve significant results since the nucleotides carry genetic code context. The proposed FAWMF algorithm is adaptive and outperforms significantly to process DNA signal contents. The algorithm applied to variety of DNA datasets produced noteworthy discrimination between coding and non-coding regions contrary to fixed window length conventional filters.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260716303728","DOI":"10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.06.021","ISSN":"0169-2607","journalAbbreviation":"Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","author":[{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Muneer"},{"family":"Jung","given":"Low Tan"},{"family":"Bhuiyan","given":"Al-Amin"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,1]]}}

The matching pursuit algorithm of Mallat and Zhang is such a method and is discussed in the context of discretized Gabor functions on an interval. We describe two software implementations based on these dictionaries. Both implementations rely on functions defined on an interval to avoid edge effects. One implementation allows for users to have great flexibility in the Gabor dictionary to be used. This is a useful improvement over other implementations, which only allow for a fixed dictionary.

This entails three main contributions: (a) We provide a formal motivation for harmonic time-vertex analysis as an analysis tool for the state evolution of simple Partial Differential Equations on graphs. (b) We improve the accuracy of joint filtering operators by up-to two orders of magnitude. (c) Using our joint filters, we construct time-vertex dictionaries analyzing the different scales and the local time-frequency content of a signal. The utility of our tools is illustrated in numerous applications and datasets, such as dynamic mesh denoising and classification, still-video inpainting, and source localization in seismic events.

Classical signal processing techniques have been used for PD signal denoising, but few approaches evaluate or present effective methods to attenuate impulsive and amplitude modulated (AM) noises, which are commonly found in on-site measurements. In this paper, a PD denoising method based on an over complete wavelet dictionary and Basis Pursuit Denoising (BPD) is presented. We describe the overall denoising algorithm and propose a methodology to compose the over complete dictionaries, starting from candidate wavelet families. The procedure starts by identifying the best families, followed by a method to define the number of families and their best combination. We show that the procedure gives better results when compared to a random choice of families, and present several processing cases based on simulated and measured signals.","DOI":"10.1109/INSCIT.2017.8103524","author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"F.

However, current research is focussing mainly on the analysis of centre of pressure excursion and lacks consensus on how to assess joint movement during postural control tasks. This study introduces a new signal processing technique to comprehensively quantify joint sway during standing and evaluates its reproducibility. Fifteen patients with non-specific low back pain and ten asymptomatic participants performed three repetitions of a 60-second standing task on foam surface. This procedure was repeated on a second day. Lumbar spine movement was recorded using an inertial measurement system. The signal was temporally divided into six sections. Two outcome variables (mean absolute sway and sways per second) were calculated for each section. The reproducibility of single and averaged measurements was quantified with linear mixed-effects models and the generalizability theory. A single measurement of ten seconds duration revealed reliability coefficients of .75 for mean absolute sway and .76 for sways per second. Averaging a measurement of 40 seconds duration on two different days revealed reliability coefficients higher than .90 for both outcome variables. The outcome variables’ reliability compares favourably to previously published results using different signal processing techniques or centre of pressure excursion. The introduced signal processing technique with two outcome variables to quantify joint sway during standing proved to be a highly reliable method. Since different populations, tasks or measurement tools could influence reproducibility, further investigation in other settings is still necessary. Nevertheless, the presented method has been shown to be highly promising.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021929016312337","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.11.054","ISSN":"0021-9290","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Biomechanics","author":[{"family":"Rast","given":"Fabian Marcel"},{"family":"Graser","given":"Judith Verena"},{"family":"Meichtry","given":"André"},{"family":"Ernst","given":"Markus Josef"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Christoph Michael"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,25]]}}

Among them, the algebraic and geometric signal processing methods are shown to be one of the most powerful tools for the representation of the classical signal processing method. In this paper, we provide an overview of recent contributions pertaining to the algebraic and geometric signal processing. Specifically, the paper focuses on the mathematical structures behind the signal processing by emphasizing the algebraic and geometric structure of the signal processing. The two major topics were discussed. First, the classical signal processing concepts are related to the algebraic structures, and the recent results associated with the algebraic signal processing theory are introduced. Second, the recent progress of the geometric signal and information processing representations associated with the geometric structure are discussed. From these discussions, it is concluded that the research on the algebraic and geometric structure of signal processing can help the researchers to understand the signal processing tools deeply, and also help us to find novel signal processing methods in signal processing community. Its practical applications are expected to grow significantly in years to come, given that the algebraic and geometric structure of signal processing offer many advantages over the traditional signal processing.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214914713000251","DOI":"10.1016/j.dt.2013.03.002","ISSN":"2214-9147","journalAbbreviation":"Defence Technology","author":[{"family":"Tao","given":"Ran"},{"family":"Li","given":"Bing-zhao"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Hua-fei"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,1]]}}

The proposed algorithms are processed based on an online adaptive threshold. Using the proposed separation algorithm guarantees precise estimation of rotor/flux angle and efficient sensorless control of the induction machine. A sensorless induction motor drive is implemented in the laboratory. Extensive experimental results are presented.
